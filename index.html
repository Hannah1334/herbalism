<h1>Basic Information</h1>
<img align="right" style="height:90%;" src="http://i.imgur.com/a4NxsoZ.jpg"/>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
Interestingly enough about Jinny, other Forest Nymphs whose birth bodies are plants as small as her own end up having humanoid bodies much like dwarves. While she is short when compared to most adult humans, she's nowhere near toddler-to-young-child size, which has to do with the rare condition some plants acquire that allows them to reach beyond their own limitations. The combination of the strength of chemicals found in her plant, as well as its age and the intensity of mana attached to her allowed her to be somewhat average in height, size, and shape. She has a definite hourglass figure with a decent bust and rounded rear. Her face is narrow but fits wonderfully with the rest of her body in its size and shape. A long slender nose, thin smiling green lips, and narrow reddish pink eyes are framed by a head of dark green hair. Her whole body is colored much like her birth plant, her hair being the darkest shade of green. Her skin is a soft mint-green and some places on her flesh one can just barely make out the shape of her birth plant's leaves.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
For Forest Nymphs, their intentions, ambitions, and personalities will decide how they look. Thanks to her innocence and naive personality, Jinny is very vibrant and beautiful. She's a pretty chill person from the start, quick to call strangers her allies and just sort of goes with the flow. She's neither difficult or disagreeable, but can have violent moodswings if she feels threatened.

When "Forest Nymphs" push beyond the limitations of High Mage and embark on one of the rank paths, so long as one of their trees is Paganism the patron guardian of that tree--sometimes referred to as Mother Nature herself--blesses them and fully awakens their internal magic potential. Achieving this very rare and powerful feat no longer makes them "Forest Nymphs" but instead gives them the new title of an "Awakened Dryad." Jinny Grass is now one of these Dryads.

<h1>History and Lore</h1>
<img align="right" style="height:90%;" src="http://i.imgur.com/tKgSebv.png"/>
All this, everything you're about to discover, was all started by mana. Mana is a life force that inhabits everything whether sentient or not. Even mana itself is somewhat sentient, imbued with intent so strong that some scholars believe that if enough mana gathered in one place at one time, it would give something inanimate complete consciousness and life. 
<br><br>
Actually, this occurance did happen, deep in the forests of medieval Europe. Finally it was common knowledge to the human race that magic was at everyone's fingertips. Magic flourished and the presence of mana became stronger and stronger until thick mystical fogs surrounded every tree. As time passed, mana embedded itself into each tree and foliage, each plant began growing its own sense of self awareness. 
<br><br>
A strong man who called himself Willow came from one of the forests with skin as rough as bark and hair as green as leaves. He claimed he'd spent hundreds of years watching life as a tree and had such a yearning to experience life like the lucky mobile creatures got to, until his wish became so strong that he just stepped right out of the tree! Of course at first Willow was celebrated, a new magical creature full of wisdom for them to learn from! Unfortunately, those with false power--the power of wealth--soon felt threatened. In their paranoia they feared that an army of these creatures would emerge and their authority and fame would fade into nothing. In an attempt of self preservation they spread lies, declaring that Willow was a dangerous creature and only agreed to be friendly to the humans in order to destroy them from the inside out. Terrified, the humans quickly turned on the newborn Nymph, and they burned him at the stake. 
<br><br>
Years passed and this continued to happen all over the Earth. Earth Nymphs would be born, only to be viciously hunted and destroyed. Eventually even magic itself was an enemy of human control. Religions turned against any magical creature, calling their existence a blasphemy and sin against their gods until the Earth Nymphs learned that having a mobile body meant living in fear. 
<br><br>
Centuries upon centuries passed with silence. Less and less Earth Nymphs were born until eventually the whole world just seemed to forget they existed. At least, until Grass was born. 
<br><br>
Grass was a strong Marijuana plant that had been growing for a long time without being discovered or torn down by natural elements. Of course, Grass knew a lot about human culture. It'd watched hundreds of hikers, campers, and evil-doers traverse through its forest right below its own perch. It'd heard all the conversations, all the musics, all the life, and wanted a taste of this life for itself. Its desire to live mobile was so strong that, just like Willow all those years ago, Grass' leaves pulled back and out stepped a young woman with red eyes so wide, innocent, and full of excitement. 
<br><br>
It took her a long time to find human civilization, which was perhaps a good thing. Along the way she had the opportunity of learning about all sorts of mobile creatures that all looked different, behaved different, and even ate different. She even had the chance to discover more about herself. By the time she reached the borders of a Grecian city she was fluent in several animal languages as well as basic human English. She traded the thin leaves for cloth garments and began the long strainuous task of studying human behavior. It took a long time, but eventually she felt confident enough to fit in with the general populace despite her obviously inhuman appearance. 
<br><br>
Grass became Jinny Grass, and she certainly studied well, because no matter where she went, she made a lot of human friends and allies. It probably had something to do with the fact that she was literally a magic Marijuana spirit, but who knows?!
</div>
<div id="tab2">
<h1>Racial Abilities of a Forest Nymph</h1>
<b>Stinky Pores</b><br>
When Jinny's body temperature rises, rather than sweat her pores release small doses of THC into the air. 
<br><br>
<b>Feed to Breed</b><br>
Because she is a physical manifestation of a full grown Marijuana plant, if major wounds are inflicted to her body, she must consume raw Marijuana stalks before being healed, allowing her to regenerate the cells needed for the process. 
<br><br>
<b>Herbal Resistance</b><br>
All Forest Nymphs have a strong resistance to natural earthgrown plants and fungi that cause a change in mental function, no matter how slight. 
<br><br>
<b>Thick as Bark</b><br>
While she is a plant person, that doesn't mean her flesh has the same density as her native plant. All Forest Nymphs actually have skin as tough as bark and as smooth as stone. Their bodies naturally don't generate much heat so their skin tends to be cool to the touch. 
<br><br>
<b>Flexibones</b><br>
The internal frame of Forest Nymphs is very flexible while their skin isn't so much. This means bending in awkward shapes or being kicked hard in the knee is more likely to tear through flesh before it breaks bones. 
<br><br>
<b>Photosynthesis</b><br>
Yes! Jenny cannot eat solid foods however, she can use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into "food," expelling fresh oxygen in return.
<br><br>
<h1>Racial Abilities of an Awakened Dryad</h1>
<b>Stinky Pores (Upgrade)</b><br>
When Jinny's body temperature rises, instead of expending water through her pores her body emits a cool gaseous mist filled with enough THC to get the average human high with a single deep inhale.
<br><br>
<b>Feed to Breed (Upgrade)</b><br>
While she no longer requires the consumption of her birth plant to be healed, putting excess Marijuana fibers in her system allows her flesh to regenerate and heal minor injuries so long as they were not inflicted by magic.
<br><br>
<b>Herbal Resistance (Upgrade)</b><br>
In addition to having a natural resistance to plants that affect the mind, Jinny also has a resistance to natural nonmagic poisons and venoms from plants and wild creatures alike. In addition, she has an immunity to magical herbal based spells, poisons, and venoms, that are Mage rank and below.
<br><br>
<b>Thick As Bark, Tough As Steel (Upgrade)</b><br>
The flesh of an Awakened Dryad is thick and flexible, but has a density and resistance grade equal to that of steel.
<br><br>
<b>Nature Magic's Influence</b><br>
Awakened Dryads are magical beings made from nature, and deeply in tune with nature. They are one with the untouched foliage of the wilds, and while sentient, they are still considered plants. This allows them to be positively affected by buffs or boosts specifically meant for plants or wildlife. (x2 resistance to Paganism, x1.5 weakness to Corrupted magic)
<br><br>
<b>Karma Chameleon!</b><br>
Jinny has gained the ability to change the pigmentation of her skin to any color she desires, and can even give her flesh basic patterns, but cannot achieve fancy, detailed, or anything with a multitude of colors.
<br><br>
<b>4:20</b><br>
Every year on April 20th, at 4:20 PM, Jinny is completely OP invincible for a whole minute.
<br><br>
<h1>Mana Manipulation</h1>
<i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level." </i>
<br><br>
Jinny has learned every Universal Spell currently available to all students at Ulreich University. To see the descriptions, limitations, and general information regarding each of these spells click <a target="_blank" href="http://ulreich.weebly.com/terms--keywords--universal-spells.html">THIS LINK.</a>
</div>
<div id="tab3">
<h1>Items</h1>
<b>Back-Sack</b><br>
Currently the only item in her possession other than the clothes on her back and a few spare outfits in the front pocket. Just a bookbag that ranges on the larger side, faded brown in color. It mostly carries lots of leaves, stalks, and "bushes."
<br><br>
<h1>Weapons</h1>
<b>Knife</b><br>
A simple hunting knife, the blade made of steel and seven inches in length, the hilt crafted from wood and covered in leather strips to make gripping easier.
<br><br>
<h1>High Duomancer Medium (Aquamancy)</h1>
<b>Right Arm of Lakshmi</b><br>
A second right arm has mutated on the Dryad's side, a good four inches below the shoulder of the first. It is the same in size and proportion, although unlike her original arm this mutated Duomancer aspect can retract into her body to remain dormant, unused, and unseen without the right kind of sensory (things like x-ray that can see through flesh, because just looking for a mana reading won't show much based on the situation/context). Another difference between her normal left arm and this one in particular, is that while her general skin is made from a material as durable as steel, this entire limb is coated in diamond grade "plant fibers." They retain the same exact appearance, but one is simply far more durable than the other.
<br>
This growth is named for the Hindu deity who supposedly is the goddess of wealth and prosperity, whom the Dryad will claim to have honored her with the extra limb when returning to India to set up her own "drug empire."
<br>
When casting Aquamancy spells from this limb, if they possess some sort of limited/specified rotation duration it gains a possible boost of up to two additional rotations (this only pertains to spells she has currently--High Duomancer spells included--things pitched in the future will have to specifically mention being effected at all by this passive and will cost extra points to be accessible by this Medium's abilities). This is not this Epic Medium's only ability, however, it also has a very useful trait to be utilized in exchange for specific activation with extra mana. When liquids are controlled or formed via Aquamancy spells through this particular limb, it is possible for the Medium to magically superheat the liquid (without the liquid catching fire) into a state that allows it to melt through--or cause damage to--things of equal rank to the particular spell. (For example, if it's a Mage spell, the liquid will only be superheated to possibly melt through iron, but if it's a High Duomancer spell it will be superheated to melt through diamond.)
<br>
This action allows a magical resistance to the liquid being evaporated, and while it's still most certainly possible, the process is considerably slower.
<br><br>
<h1>High Duomancer Medium (Paganism)</h1>
<b>Left Arm of Vishnu</b><br>
A second left arm has mutated on the Dryad's side, a good four inches below the shoulder of the first. It is the same in size and proportion, although unlike her original arm this mutated Duomancer aspect can retract into her body to remain dormant, unused, and unseen without the right kind of sensory (things like x-ray that can see through flesh, because just looking for a mana reading won't show much based on the situation/context). Another difference between her normal left arm and this one in particular, is that while her general skin is made from a material as durable as steel, this entire limb is coated in diamond grade "plant fibers." They retain the same exact appearance, but one is simply far more durable than the other.
<br>
This growth is named for the Hindu deity who supposedly is the preserver and protector of life, an ironic fit for her own role as a Dryad.
<br>
When casting Paganism spells from this limb, if they possess some sort of range (whether this range pertains to "Area of Effect," how long something is or can stretch, or even if the range refers to how far away from her the said spell can be active) it gains a possible boost of up to five whole feet (this only pertains to spells she has currently--High Duomancer spells included--things pitched in the future will have to specifically mention being effected at all by this passive and will cost extra points to be accessible by this Medium's abilities). This is not this Epic Medium's only ability, however, it also has a very useful trait to be utilized in exchange for specific activation with extra mana. It allows Jinny to combine aspects of two separate Paganism spells (again, only the ones in her possession at the time of the Medium's approval, High Duomancer spells included) into one. One of the spells she wishes to combine must already be activated, and she must actively choose to cast the second spell "over" or "onto" the first, technically requiring both to be activated separately for a combined result (will always require at least two rotations for completion, on top of the activation rotation requirement some of her spells may already have).

<h1>Elementalism: Aquamancy, High Duomancer</h1>
<img align="left" style="height:90%;" src="http://i.imgur.com/S35cc8e.jpg"/>
<i>"Often seen as the most primal or basic form of magic, Elementalists tap into one of six different elements to produce their magic. Each possesses a different mana type, and may use their spells to generate their chosen element. Aquamancy is the control of water and other liquids." </i>
<br><br>
<b>Liquidity</b><br>
The caster can either create orbs of water out of nothing, or manipulate any natural liquid source within forty-five feet of her body--or High Mage ranking (or lower) magical liquid source so long as it is within thirty-five feet of her body (equal ranking or lower magical liquid can be controlled via this spell if an ally allows it to be)--to make these orbs. If physical contact is made with an already bleeding target she can manipulate their blood, even draw it out of them through openings in their flesh in order to create these orbs. She can have up to twelve basketball sized orbs active at once, or four massive orbs that have the potential of covering up to a ten foot radius individually. These liquid constructs can either be immediately shot like projectiles (up to thirty feet away), or manipulated around her body for a twenty foot radius. The projectiles can't reach speeds over 90 MPH. 
<br><br>
<b>Bubble, Bubble, POP!</b><br>
This spell allows her to make bubbles up to the size of basketballs. These water bubbles are hollow--filled with just natural air--but the surrounding water-walls can be thick; up to six inches of thickness! 
<br><br>
<b>CoatDensation!</b><br>
When using this spell, Jinny can coat anything she desires in a layer of condensation without changing the object's natural temperature. The object cannot be bigger than herself, and if it is, she can only coat a specific area of the object. Object of desire must be within twenty feet of Jinny and visible (directly in her line of sight). 
<br><br>
<b>Hose Blast</b><br>
This spell creates a high pressure blast of water strong enough to warp objects and/or constructs/attacks/spells of Diamond toughness. The spray can extend up to fifty feet away from the caster, and makes a cone-like shape, small and thin nearer to its source and expanding up to twenty-five feet in width and height at its very end. Up to four of these can be active at once--as long as a limb is being used to cast it--and it can be cast continuously in exchange for a constant mana drain. 
<br><br>
<b>Gentle Kiss</b><br>
This spell is similar in nature to CoatDensation, but instead of coating something in a layer of water, she can coat it in a thin layer of watered down Batrachotoxin (Object she intends to coat must come in physical contact with her). If this spell comes in contact with flesh long enough or is directly consumed, there's enough toxin in it to cause paralysis. If the target makes direct skin contact with the toxin, they will be paralyzed in a matter of seconds. Paralysis only lasts three posts.
<br><br>
<b>Hydrate!</b><br>
A thin layer of water that covers the caster--or a specified target--in a moldable suit-like construct. When used on botanic creatures, this suit boosts their physical speed, mental processing speed, and reaction time by five (x5, caps at x7 if stacked with other buffs). While this water has no resistance to physical objects, it does stand as armor against magical constructs and energy based spells of equal rank or lower (if hit by energy post hm class 2 shield will be dropped, as well as speed buff and all other speed bufs. Will move at ⅓ speed for 2 posts before recovering. If hit by true pract energy the same applies but the attack also connects). In addition, since the spell itself is made of liquid it allows those affected to become very slipperly like an eel. This spell can only be active on up to two sentient beings at a time, and if that being is not the original caster, it will only remain active so long as the affected person is within forty feet of the caster. Lasts a total of six rotations and requires two to cool down.
<br>
A new aspect to be added onto this spell allows the caster to shoot over the surface of bodies of water, or, toxic liquid of her own creation (whether as big as a lake or as small as a puddle) at incredible speeds (an additional x1.5 onto the speed buff already in place for this spell if it's a natural body of water, but it remains the same and gains no additional buff if it's water or liquid of her own creation) without being harmed by the liquid itself. Doing this/Using this aspect will cause said liquid to shoot and splash away from the caster off to the sides, how far the splash depending on how big the body of water and how fast the person is traveling. (Small things like puddles only splashing two feet to the sides, big things like lakes splashing ten feet to the sides in ten-foot-high waves)
<br><br>
<b>Hot Steam</b><br>
The caster emits a thick cloud of warm steam from their body, which isn't intended to obstruct vision in the slightest. Instead, this mystical mist is designed to relax the muscles and inflict a state of general calm and serenity. While it CAN be used like a sauna, to sweat away stress and freshen the body and mind, if both the caster and the target are within the steam for up to two rotations the more sinister effects set in; allowing the caster to manipulate the blood inside the target's body (only works a little at first, not full movements, works more over time). It cannot be used to draw the blood out of them (unless openings are actively made in their flesh by cuts or other injuries) but it can be used for basic directional control, such as causing an arm or leg to spazz out. After remaining in the mist for 2-3 rotations, her level of control over water in the body will increase, allowing her to do more than just jerk her opponent about and actually do basic directional control. (Cannot be used to control every little action or muscle at first, more broad like a puppet on a string and requires a lot of strength, mana, and focus. This means she cannot move in to physically attack while it is active, because she will be busy focusing her mind and energy on the spell's abilities. In addition, characters who are physically stronger than the caster can overpower the spell at beginning strength, but once they have been within the radius long enough for the amount of control she has over them to increase this will go away completely). Should both parties remain in this mist for extended periods of time (five rotations) or be in physical contact for extended periods of time (two rotations), the caster may use it to stop the flow of blood altogether and clot into a singular area, effectively offing their prey if the right area is chosen. (Clotting can be done by the mind for the five rotation mark, and clotting by touch will be far more effective and can take place wherever she is physically connected to her victim.)
<br>
This steam can only stretch out for up to fifty feet in every direction away from the caster (first post it starts at fifteen feet, second post is thirty, then third is fifty), and can easily be blown away by spells of at least post high mage rank path level one (lower ranked spells can also blow it away, it would just require more than one rotation depending on rank, i.e.: High Mage would require two rotations, Expert would require three, etc). "Control" over bloodflow can only be harnassed on up to three victims at once. After five rotations, the mist will dissipate, and four rotations of cooldown will be required before it can be cast again.

<h1>Paganism, High Duomancer</h1>
<img align="left" style="height:70%;" src="http://i.imgur.com/3OqFdpX.jpg"/>
<i>"The Pagans are mages who wield the destructive forces of nature. A Pagan may begin with simple abilities, such as talking to animals, making plants grow, or making small rain clouds. However, as these mages practice and hone their craft, powerful storms will accumulate at their command, and charging beasts will follow their every word. Such mages even possess the ability to cultivate and assault others with deadly diseases and viruses, and can create natural disasters after attaining highly skilled control with their magic. " </i>
<br><br>
<b>Steroids!</b><br>
Jinny can speed up the growth of any small number of plants (5-10) within a ten foot radius of herself in exchange for a big chunk of her mana. Takes one post to bring all to adulthood. Cannot produce large trees, and takes an extra post for any flower or fruit small trees and shrubs might bear. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Seed</b><br>
By concentrating her mana into one small pressurized point, the caster can create a seed out of her mana. This seed may grow into any plant the caster knows to exist--so long as the tree or plant isn't a towering piece of nature--but no more than four seeds can be made at a time. For the original seeds to wear off so new ones can be planted, original plants must be destroyed or uprooted. Takes two posts to grow the seed into an adult plant. 
<br><br>
<b>Manipulation</b><br>
If she casts this spell on any nearby small-to-medium plant within a fifteen foot radius of herself, whether they be carnivorous or not, she can telepathically control that plant within the same fifteen foot radius. Cannot have more than three under her control at once. 
<br><br>
<b>Oh no, both ends!</b><br>
Jinny can manipulate a mana-mutated stomach virus that causes intense nausea, uncontrollable diarrhea, and intense headaches as soon as it enters the system. Can only be transferred through physical contact with either Jinny or the spell itself. The sickness only lasts for three posts before it leaves the body. Can be cured by any mage rank and above Faith mage or fellow Paganist. Any other mage with a sensory spell the same rank as this one (or higher) would be able to tell whether or not something is laced with the disease. Takes two posts until spell is ready to be cast. 
<br><br>
<b>Nature's Armor</b><br>
Jinny gathers enough resources (sticks, branches, vines, small stones, etc) to form a giant tree golem around her body, which can measure up to ten feet in height and three feet in width. The magic weaving through this construct which binds its many pieces together causes them to all have a Diamond grade durability. While the Dryad remains protected in the golem's chest cavity, she is able to control it completely like a massive puppet. This giant amaglamation weighs nearly six hundred pounds and has five times the strength of the average human, but only moves at two thirds the speed thanks to its added weight. 
<br>
This makeshift armor of sorts can only remain active for a total of four rotations and requires two to cool down before it can be formed once more.
<br><br>
<b>Vine Tentacles</b><br>
A spell that can grow up to eight long vine tendrils with sharp tips from the caster's back, four on each side of the spine. Each vine has the girth of six inches individually, and each are naturally about twelve feet in length. In order to extend the length of a singular tendril, however, the caster can sacrifice and retract the others--along with extra mana--for an extra five feet from each (so if seven tendrils were sacrificed to lengthen the eighth, it would total at forty-seven feet in length but remain six inches in girth). The vine constructs themselves are as tough as Diamond and act as extra limbs to the caster, responding to mental commands just as the rest of her own body would. If a tendril is cut, however, they will cause the caster pain as though an arm or a leg has been lost.

<b>Deep Root</b><br>
When in contact with a solid surface that is populated (or covered) by natural flora and fauna (including those of her own magical creation but excluding magically created anomalies, artificial intelligence, etc made by other mages or crafted by mundane hands) she can pump that surface full of her mana and in exchange close her eyes to extend her consciousness up to an area around her with a fifty foot radius, allowing her to feel through roots or critters. This will allow her to feel things like vibrations detected in the earth by plant roots, harmful gaseous substances being filtered through flora, in addition to being able to see through the eyes of critters (only one creature at a time), hear through their ears, or smell with their noses (only works on npcs unless a pc allows her entry). Using this method can even allow her to detect intentionally magically hidden harmful substances, movements, etc that wouldn’t normally be detected by base nature assuming the cloaking spells are lesser rank. If a sentient critter lesser than the caster’s rank is within this spell’s radius, focusing on their mind and using their senses to gather information for a whole rotation can allow her temporary control over the creature as though projecting her consciousness into their body, if they leave the fifty foot limit, are killed/destroyed, or remain under her control for more than four rotations she’ll lose them and be forced to start the entire process over. The ability of control is confined to smaller and more harmless animals (venomous snakes are fine but massive beasts such as cockatrices or dragons are off limits).

<b>Bloodflower Birth; How to be a Bloodmother for Dummies</b><br>
A spell that literally creates a specific kind of creature for Jinny to control, which she has affectionately named "the Bloodflower." Sentient beings--about as sentient as typical house pets like dogs or cats--whose humanoid bodies are completely made of plant fibers that can come in various shades of green, with massive heads that seem to be giant red or pink rosebuds. At their tallest, they stand no higher than four feet, but their heavy muscle tone and thick flesh causes them to weigh two hundred pounds at the least, and two-hundred-fifty at the most. Rather than fingers or toes they possess sharp hard thorn-like growths shaped into claws, naturally as tough and durable as Diamond. From their elbows, knees, and even down their spines, actual thorns of the same durability grow from their plant flesh. Each individual claw is about eight inches long and two inches thick, while each individual thorn is roughly five inches long and half one inch thick. 
<br>
Much like their creator, these beings survive by feeding off of water and photosynthesis, making them incredibly sensitive to airborn and liquid based toxins. Microscopic pores all over their bodies have a filter system which allows them to separate the good from the bad in the air, leaving the toxins on their surface flesh which can potentially transmit diseases through physical contact if they are carrying a common sickness on the outside of their bodies (only works for nonmagical toxins/poisons/diseases/etc. example: forest fire creating heavy smoke in the air, skin would filter the good stuff in and leave the bad chemicals out to just idly coat their flesh until removed or washed away). The fibers that make up their skin and bones are so tightly knit and high strung that they produce a density of Tungsten, and possess a grip--and can throw a punch--just as strong. 
<br>
While Bloodflowers have no eyes, ears, or mouth, there are tendrils within the center of their flower-bud heads that can taste the air for smells and fluctuation in temperature, allowing them to sense things that are hotter or colder than their general surroundings. It is possible for them to function on their own free will, but unless given direction (which can be done mentally by their creator) they are pretty stupid and brute-like. 
<br>
These creatures do have an internal system that keeps them alive and working. Their equivalent to lungs and a stomach are one singular organ, which is connected to the ends of their air-feeling tendrils that allow them to suck water into their bodies like straws as well as carbon and oxygen. They also have a brain-like membrane that sits in the left side of their chest, while their blood-pumping heart muscle rests in the right. Much like most living creatures, they do have blood and a whole vein network that keeps them alive and healthy. Within their blood they naturally carry a deadly parasite, both creatures have a symbiotic relationship with one another. The parasites feed off and dispose of the Bloodflower's waste (haha they don't have to pee or poop!), in turn allowing their own pinhead sized bodies to produce an incredibly acidic substance that carries a lot of necessary vitamins and nutrients to keep the texture, pressure, and sugar in the Bloodflower's blood well balanced. While contained within their bodies, this acid substance is only strong enough to eat through iron at the most, but when exposed to massive amounts of oxygen at once the acid reacts violently and a chemical reaction causes it to become corrosive enough to eat through Diamond grade constructs/materials both magical and nonmagical. 
<br>
In addition, the parasites within the acid may survive outside of the blood for a single rotation, allowing them the potential to burrow into a target surface and produce more of their acid from the inside (as long as the target surface is not more durable than Titanium, otherwise their tiny mouths won't be able to chew through).
<br>
Jinny can only create up to four of these beings at one time, and are designed to be ticking time bombs. They can only be active for seven posts at the most, before they spontaneously combust into their own explosions of force, blood, and body parts. Each explosion can cover a fifteen-foot radius, and the force of the blast is strong enough to shatter Tungsten at its epicenter, and Titanium at its edges. Six rotations of cool-down are required after reaching the limit of four beasts at once, before another can be made.

<b>Bloodflower Behemoth</b><br>
While very similar to its Bloodflower brethren, the Behemoth still differs in its own unique way, the most obvious being its sheer size. This massive creature stands at a full height of twenty feet, its muscular body naturally scaling in proportion so that its size matches its shape, and causing the thing to weigh nearly a ton! Rather than hands, the upper body limbs of this creature are thorny sharp mandibles that can cut like blades. On its feet, rather than toes, the beast has huge curved thorny claws three feet in length and six inches thick. From its elbows, knees, and down the length of its spine, thorn growths of Diamond protrude from its equally durable flesh, each individual thorn one foot in length and four inches thick.
<br>
This temporary monster is not nearly as internally intricate as its smaller counterparts.
<br>
It absorbs through the pores in its flesh as they do, but its waste leaks out through its skin. The blood it’s named for has gained an acidic quality, although it’s more diluted than its smaller counterparts with the highest durability it’s able to melt through (without contact for long extended periods of time) is Tungsten. Still no eyes or ears, but this version of the beast does possess huge jaws that protectively surround the sensitive tendrils in the center of its flower-bud head, complete with sharp Diamond grade teeth ready to rip into whatever lies in its path. While the other Bloodflowers use the tendrils to “see” in thermal energy, this beast’s creator has developed an addition that allows it to detect different scents as well, opening the possibility of being overwhelmed by absurd and powerful smells while also giving it another form of sensory to rely on for navig ation other than just thermal readings.
<br>
Designed to be a destructive tank with a short life this beast's plant fiber flesh and bones are as durable as Diamond, and its natural strength--thanks to its massive size--is four times that of the average human's (x4), but its natural speed is only three quarters of the average human's (x0.75). This creature has no smarts, and its brain only functions on instinct of movement and instinct of destruction. Its creator is only able suppress its violent tendencies and keep it docile immediately after creation, but once it has been let loose or performs an offensive act, it will continue on a singular path until its time has run out. 
<br>
The Behemoth can only be active for up to six rotations before it too erupts into a massive explosion of force that carries its body parts and guts like shrapnel. Like the smaller versions of its kind, the explosion at its epicenter is only durable enough to shatter Tungsten, and then Titanium around its edges, but unlike the smaller versions the explosion has a massive radius of effect of forty feet. Three rotations of cool-down are required before another Behemoth can be created.
